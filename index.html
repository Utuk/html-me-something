      <h1>Elizabeth Utuk Resume</h1>
      <p>Meticulous Manager/Project Coordinator who undertakes complex 
          assignments, meets tight deadlines and delivers superior performance. 
          Practical knowledge gained through film production projects as a 
          producer, in retail management and through various promotional campaigns.
          Highly qualified and skilled individual with an ability to take

          <br>
          <br>
      </p>For example, to increase my store's customer traffic flow and brand name
       in our town, I assembled a GNC booth at a local 5k charity race. Through 
       contacting the local charity race coordinators I was able to support and 
       capitalize on the race by turning it into a great public relations event 
       for the store all at no cost to the store owners.
